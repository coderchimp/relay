# relay
A few years back I ran the tech for a summer swim team. I had just written a thing on the site telling parents to not bother the coaches about who was or was not selected for the relays (espcially the "A" relay) when I noticed that one of my kids "should" have been selected.
Rather than bug the coach - I wrote this script that took the data from team unify of the swimmers who would be at the meet and generated the theoretical fastest relays possible.
Team Unify at the time had a feature to do this but it did not work for many of the age groups as the relays were more likely to be 100 yards (25y for each stroke and the times the swimmers had were a mix of 50 and 25y).

When it was first written parents had to indicate in a comment block that they wanted a relay. Later it was changed to be that they indicated that they were not able to do a relay.

Fun Fact: Parents being parents would write things in the comment block that showed they did not understand that a machine was parsing data, so I would dump that to the screen and add rules to handle it if ness.

After my kids stopped swimming I handed this off to my replacement, no clue if it kept going.

The other script was an attempt to help the coaches get a "Most improved" swimmer for the diff age groups.
